# Pathfinding Visualizer
Pathfinding Visualizer is a web application built using React, Express and Node.js that allows users to visualize various pathfinding algorithms in action.

# Introduction
Pathfinding Visualizer is a tool designed to help users understand the behavior and performance of various pathfinding algorithms. It provides an intuitive user interface for selecting algorithms, adjusting parameters, and visualizing the process in real-time.

# Problem Statement
Pathfinding algorithms are essential in applications such as routing in maps, network optimization, and robotics. However, understanding the inner workings of these algorithms can be challenging. Pathfinding Visualizer aims to bridge this gap by providing a visual representation of how these algorithms work.

# Project Objectives
Develop an interactive user interface for visualizing pathfinding algorithms.
Support multiple pathfinding algorithms and allow users to compare their performance.

# Features
Selection of various pathfinding algorithms.
Interactive grid manipulation.
Visualization controls for speed and step-by-step execution.

# Technologies Used
React: Front-end framework for building user interfaces.
Express: Web application framework for Node.js, used for building the backend API.
Node.js: JavaScript runtime environment for executing server-side code.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
